TempMail Service ‚Äì Smarter Temporary Email üì¨‚öôÔ∏è

This project was created to explore how temporary email services work, diving deep into the APIs and architectures behind them. What started as a curiosity-driven idea turned into a two-phase project that reflects my growth in backend and API integration skills.

Why This Project?

I wanted to understand:

How temporary emails are generated

What technologies power them

How to create a secure and user-accessible temp mail service


To do this, I built two versions of the project ‚Äî each with its own lessons and improvements.


---

Version 1 (v1): The Beginning üß™

Used 1secmail API (open source)

Allowed users to generate random emails

Added an admin panel to track generated emails

Limitations: Built in pure HTML, no backend = no data persistence

Result: Emails were lost after generation, and 1secmail eventually became a paid service



---

Version 2 (v2): The Evolution üöÄ

After identifying v1‚Äôs drawbacks, I discovered the mail.tm API, which changed the game:

Supports both email + password generation

Enables users to revisit inboxes securely

Offers a better, more user-friendly experience

Solves the biggest challenge: persistent access to temp mailboxes



---

Project Highlights

Generate disposable email addresses instantly

Secure access with auto-generated passwords

Access inbox messages on your own terms

Simple UI but powerful under the hood


> From one-time access to full control ‚Äî this project reflects how tech can evolve with thoughtful iteration.
