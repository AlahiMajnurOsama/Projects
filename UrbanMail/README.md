This project was developed as a means to explore and understand temporary email services—specifically, how they function and the technologies that power them. My goal was to deepen my knowledge on this subject, and to achieve that, I created this project as a series of practical examples showcasing what I learned.

In the first version of the project (v1), I utilized the 1secmail API, which is an open-source solution, to create a personalized environment where users could receive messages. Within this framework, I experimented with a new feature called the admin panel, which stored a list of all generated emails. However, I encountered a limitation: the project was built with only HTML, meaning it didn't have a backend database to preserve email data. Consequently, whenever a user clicked on the option to generate a new email, it created a random email address, but with no means to access that email again in the future.

As the 1secmail service transitioned to a paid model, I was effectively unable to continue with v1, leading me to rethink my approach. Recognizing the limitations of the previous iteration, especially the lack of future access to old emails, I decided to advance to version 2 (v2) of the project. I concluded that what was needed was an application that would not only generate temporary emails but would also securely provide users with the passwords needed to access those emails later.

After conducting thorough research, I stumbled upon an interesting API called mail.tm. This service stood out because it offers not only random email addresses but also associated passwords, allowing users to retain future access to their temporary emails. In v2, I integrated the mail.tm API into my application, which maintains the concept of temporary emails while enhancing the user experience by enabling ongoing access.

The result is essentially a similar concept to other temporary email services, but with a significant improvement—users can now revisit their generated email boxes with the credentials provided. This iteration not only fulfills the original intent of enabling users to receive messages but also empowers them with the ability to access those messages on their own terms, making it a more practical and user-friendly tool for managing temporary communications.
