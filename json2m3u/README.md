JSON to M3U Converter üîÑüì∫

This project is a supportive utility tool developed during the creation of my IPTV-based applications: Retro and Urban Stream. While building these platforms, I needed a simple way to convert JSON-formatted channel lists into the widely supported M3U playlist format‚Äîso I created this tool to solve that problem efficiently.

Why This Project?

In IPTV systems, M3U files are the backbone of media streaming. However, channel data is often managed in JSON structures. To bridge the gap, this tool was designed to:

Automatically parse JSON channel lists

Generate M3U-compatible output for playback in IPTV players

Ensure quick, clean, and reusable conversions for any media streaming environment



---

Key Features ‚öôÔ∏è

One-click JSON to M3U conversion

Lightweight and easy to integrate into any IPTV project

Reusable for other media-related tools or automation pipelines

Ideal for developers working on custom streaming platforms

A Personal Touch

This tool may be small in scope, but it played a big role in the backend logic of my larger IPTV solutions. It reflects my approach to development: building exactly what I need, when I need it, and then refining it into something reusable and helpful for others too.
