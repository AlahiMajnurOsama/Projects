Custom SMS API Solution ❌📱

This project was my attempt to build a custom SMS solution powered by API integration — crafted with the goal of improving communication across platforms in a seamless, cost-free way.

What It Aimed To Do

The system was designed to work with several platforms:

Badhan – for sending user notifications

Hisab Express – to log and manage transactions

Robi Express – to deliver One-Time Passwords (OTPs)


By combining these tools, the solution could send custom SMS messages efficiently and without additional cost — a concept that held a lot of potential.

Why It Was Discontinued

Despite the technical promise, deeper development revealed critical vulnerabilities — some of which raised serious ethical concerns. These issues could have impacted not only the system operators but also the privacy and safety of end users.

After thoughtful reflection, I made the tough but responsible decision to shut down this project. As a developer, I believe in building tools that respect privacy, security, and ethical integrity — even if that means walking away from something I worked hard on.

> Sometimes, knowing when to stop is part of progress.
This project remains archived as a reminder of that principle.
