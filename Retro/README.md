IPTV Streaming System 📺🌐

This project explores the world of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) — a modern approach to delivering TV content over the internet instead of traditional broadcast methods.

Project Overview

At its core, this system allows users to:

Play media streams from m3u / m3u8 playlists

Use four different media players for enhanced compatibility and smoother playback

Simply paste a playlist link, and the system auto-fetches available channels

Stream live content directly and seamlessly


Each player was handpicked to support various streaming protocols, ensuring a flexible and uninterrupted viewing experience for the user.

Why I Built It

This project began as a personal learning journey, sparked by my curiosity about IPTV technology. I was fascinated by how media streaming works behind the scenes — from playlist parsing to real-time playback.

Through this experience, I gained deep insights into:

IPTV system architecture

Streaming protocols and compatibility challenges

Designing user-friendly playback mechanisms

A Note on Ethics & Discontinuation ⚠️

While the technical possibilities were exciting, it’s important to acknowledge that unauthorized IPTV streaming may violate copyright laws.

In light of this, I made the responsible choice to discontinue the project to uphold legal and ethical standards.

> Learning is valuable — but ethics are non-negotiable.



This project remains a significant part of my growth as a developer, and the lessons I’ve learned will continue to guide my future innovations.
