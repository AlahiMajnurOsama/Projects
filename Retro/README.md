This project is centered around Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), which is a method of delivering television content over the internet instead of through traditional broadcasting methods. For this project, I designed a comprehensive mechanism that enables users to play media streams from m3u or m3u8 playlists, which are prevalent formats for organizing and accessing streaming content.

Within this project, I incorporated four different media players, providing users with a versatile and uninterrupted viewing experience. Each player was selected to ensure compatibility with various streaming protocols and to enhance user experience, allowing for smooth playback regardless of the selected option.

The core functionality of the project is fairly straightforward. Users are required to input the link to their m3u playlist, and the system is designed to automatically fetch the available channels contained within that playlist. Once the channels are identified, users can easily initiate streaming of their desired content, allowing for a seamless connection to their favorite shows or channels in real-time.

This project began as a personal hobby, driven by my curiosity and desire to learn more about the inner workings of IPTV technology. I dedicated significant time and effort to understand the complexities of media streaming and the challenges associated with delivering content over the internet.

However, it is important to note that IPTV streaming without appropriate permissions is prohibited and may infringe on copyright laws. As a result, I chose to discontinue the project to respect these legal boundaries and ensure ethical practices while exploring technology. Despite this, the experience gained from undertaking this project was invaluable, significantly enhancing my understanding of IPTV systems and streaming media technology.
