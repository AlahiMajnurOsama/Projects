A Password Generation Project  
This was the project for my 2nd semester. I submitted this project using C++.  
In C++, it was just a CLI project, so I decided to make it user-interactive and simple.  
It has a special feature, which is Custom Word.  
With this feature, you can add custom words to your password.  
An interactive user interface with a new approach.
