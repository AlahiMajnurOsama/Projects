This project is primarily dedicated to the enhancement of security measures. Its main objective is to develop a robust framework that utilizes HTML encryption techniques, thereby ensuring that the source code remains hidden from individuals lacking technical proficiency.

I have designed this tool to operate effectively without requiring an internet connection, enabling users to maintain the security of their HTML files in a more controlled environment. By integrating these security features, I intend to provide an additional layer of protection that safeguards sensitive information and intellectual property embedded within the code.

This approach not only addresses the pressing security concerns related to source code exposure but also empowers users to work confidently with their HTML files, assured that they have taken proactive measures to protect their work against unauthorized access and exploitation. The overarching goal is to make web development more secure and accessible, ensuring that valuable content and code remain shielded from prying eyes.
