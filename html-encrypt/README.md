HTML Encryption Security Tool 🔐💻

This project is focused on one core goal: enhancing the security of web development by protecting the source code from unauthorized access.


---

What Does It Do?

The tool is designed to:

Encrypt HTML code to obscure the source from non-technical users

Work fully offline, ensuring maximum privacy and control

Safeguard sensitive content and intellectual property

Help developers secure their static files in a lightweight and effective way

Why I Built It

As someone who values both creativity and security, I wanted to create a simple yet powerful solution for developers who need to protect their HTML projects. Whether it's a portfolio, a prototype, or an internal tool, sometimes you just want an extra layer of security—without depending on the internet or heavy frameworks.

This project allowed me to explore front-end security tactics and develop a self-contained encryption mechanism that brings peace of mind to creators.
